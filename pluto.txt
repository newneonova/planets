pluto is NOT A PLANET


Goalie is not a word that means a thing

But I think it's very interesting, especially after the New Horizons flyby. They named everything after lovecraftian 
inspired things. Sea of cthulu and such.  Probably because of the whole copyright fiasco, the disney problem. This is where the
modren shared story past is only things before the copyright laws started extending. that is why lovecraft is more
popular than tarzan, many more spinoffs, allowed the mythos or world to develop in a way that is relevant to the day to day
of the today.

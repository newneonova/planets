Mars is covered in red, not very much water or air, kind of cold, very dusty, lots of dry ice.

Mars is empty of large life.
Biggest population on mars is robots. The robots are run by people from earth. 

Mars is also a musical composition and a candy bar.

Minds infinitely superior to ours, with eager eyes, contimplated our earth and slowly and surely made their plans against us.
